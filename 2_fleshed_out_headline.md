### HTML/CSS/JS  
  
HTML/CSS/JS are the basic languages that you learned in the previous sections and they will be very useful. To make a small return on these languages, we can say this:  
* HTML:   
HTML is the markup language used to set up the structure of your web page. Several tags are used as p, a, div, span, img, ...  
* CSS :  
The style sheet or CSS is used to apply style to your web page. In the style sheet several attributes can be used as: border, background, color, margin, padding, ...  
* JS :  
The first programming language that you learned in this course. It allowed you to dynamize your web page, to perform actions without necessarily reloading your page. Thanks to its loops and conditional block features you had an overview of the algorithm.
  
### Ruby 

After this recap you were going to start Rails, to make rails, you need to have a basic knowledge of the Ruby programming language.  
  
### Ruby algorithms  
  
While doing Ruby, you had encountered problems that you had to solve and for that you had to establish a process to get to the solution each time. This was the alogrithm of Ruby, with condition blocks, loops, functions and others.  
  
### Git/Github  
  
You had learned several languages, made beautiful web pages, but you will have to keep your work somewhere outside your computer to be able to follow its evolution according to each version of the project. This is the role of Git/Github which is a VCS.
